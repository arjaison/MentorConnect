## Description
Universities implement a Mentor-Mentee system inorder to improve the performance of the students. It also allows the students to approach their respective mentors whenever they require professional and emotional guidance.
Often students feel shy to approach for help and refrain from doing so. To overcome this, we propose a communication application between the mentor and mentee, which makes the student anonymous to the teacher. We also instill an emotion detection feature for the mentor to know the mental state of their mentees.This application was created as part of the Software Engineering Courseware offered at SASTRA Deemed to be University.

## Objective
* Close the communication gap between the mentor and mentee.
* Help the mentee in sharing personal information in confidence to the mentor.
* Provide emotion detection to every text the student makes.
* Make the relationship between the two more productive, secure and efficient. 

## Functionalities
* Makes use of Firebase Real-time database for authentication and storage.
* Uses SHA-256 hash algorithm to anonimize the usernames of mentors for mainatining secrecy.
* Restricts the students from chatting with anyother faculty except their respective mentors to prevent misuse of the service.

* Allows mentors to analyse the emotional state of mentees by making use of Parallel Dots Emotion Detection API.
* Emoji support for displaying the resulting emotion in a simplified manner.
